#' Calculated likelihood of a proposed value of theta
#'
#' Takes an object of class Rasch (which includes the difficulty of each question) and a theta ("skill of the student") value
#' and uses them to calculate the likelihood of a proposed value of theta  
#'
#' @param raschObj An object of class "Rasch." Includes a vector of question difficulty and a corresponding vector indicating whether the student referenced in the object got the question correct (1) or incorrect (0) 
#' @param theta A numeric value indicating the skill of the student taking the test
#'
#' @return The likelihood of a proposed value of theta  
#'  \item{output}{The product sum calculated by multiplying the results of the second output of raschProbability all together}
