#' Calculated probability of answering the question correctly
#'
#' Takes an object of class Rasch (which includes the difficulty of each question) and a theta ("skill of the student") value
#' and uses them to calculate the probability of answering a question correctly. 
#'
#' @param raschObj An object of class "Rasch." Includes a vector of question difficulty and a corresponding vector indicating whether the student referenced in the object got the question correct (1) or incorrect (0) 
#' @param theta A numeric value of corresponding y values with the same dimensionality as \code{x}.
#'
#' @return An output list. The first slot contains the probability of the student answering each question correctly given the question's difficulty and their skill level (theta). The second slot contains a similar list. Instead of only being the probability of getting a question right, in the slots where the student got the question wrong, the probability of correct value is replaced with the probability of getting the question wrong.
